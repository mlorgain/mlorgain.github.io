				<h3>Similar Site Example</h3>
				<p>A site that is very similar in tone and format to the one I have created here is reddit. While I am aware of the subreddit r/nyc, I intend my website not to imitate the subreddit, but to curate in a similar format, a collection specifically of user-reported localities. I believe r/nyc is great at maintaining a simplistic, user-friendly interface that allows users to digest content in an easily accessible, organized format (and as is most of Reddit). A couple shortcomings I see with this r/nyc are an aesthetic that is minimal in its visual appeal and one where user commenting and posts can become easily muddled and "lost" within comment sections.</p>
